Welcome to my homepage! I am Tianxiang Zhao, a PhD student in the Pennsylvania State University, and co-advised by [Prof.Xiang Zhang](https://ist.psu.edu/directory/xzz89) and [Prof.Suhang Wang](https://suhangwang.ist.psu.edu/).

## Research
My research focuses on topics related to data-centric machine learning. Most recently, I am interested in the following topics,
- Learning with weak supervisions: 
    - Few supervision: semi-supervised and unsupervised learning; 
    - Low-quality supervision: learning with noisy labels;
    - Biased data: alleviating biases and demographic unfairness in the learned model. 
- Uncovering knowledge learned by the model:
    - Prediction and explanation co-design for intrinsically interpretable models;
    - Post-hoc explanation of a trained existing model.

<!-- Besides, I am also interested in learning from relational data and designing more scalable or efficient models. -->
