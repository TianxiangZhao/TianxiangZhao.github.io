Welcome to my homepage! I am Tianxiang Zhao, a PhD student in PSU, and co-advised by [Prof.Xiang Zhang](https://ist.psu.edu/directory/xzz89) and [Prof.Suhang Wang](https://suhangwang.ist.psu.edu/). My current research lies in (1) Imperfect supervision due to crowed-sourced data collection pipeline or intrinsic data biases, in-
cluding noisy label, imbalance, semi-supervision, etc., (2) Interpretable deep model to increase model transparency, including both ad-hoc and post-hoc
explanation strategies. Besides, I am also interested in learning from relational data and designing more scalable or efficient models.

I received my bachelor degree in Computer Science from University of Science of Technology of China in 2017. I stayed there for two years reading the master degree, advised by Prof.Guiquan Liu. Since 2019, I am persuing a PhD degree in PSU, in the college of Information Sciences and Technology.
